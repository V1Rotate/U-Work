--- WHERE THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT CAME FROM ---

I have an experience in technical sales and sales\service development in heavy equipment\machining field. So I was thinking to work on a project related to 
some construction equipment. Considered what would be less complicated and interesting to review. 

Once I was thinking about U-Haul and its commercial vehicles rental services. So I got an idea of combining the equipment\machinery and service - after the brainstorm, 
I ended up with an idea of U-Work (similar to U-Haul), where any person, let's imagine for sure, needs a Compact equipment for his construction, gardening or other needs.
Or maybe construction company need a compact equipment just for one day and wants to rent it. Also, I found a small segment of compact\subcompact multi-functional equipment
that may be used in many industries for a big number of purposes. I thought: Bingo! That is what i need. 

So, all of that was a precursor to the imagined U-Work Compact Equipment Rental Services.
